## Ancestral Immune Response Mechanisms Across Animal Lineages: Functional Analysis of Candidate Genes and Discovery of Bioactive Molecules

As undergrad I joinded the Evolutionary Immunology group dedicated to understanding immune response mechanisms across various animal lineages. As immune responses have evolved independently in diverse animal groups, many of which have only recently garnered research interest, studying these mechanisms sheds light on animals' adaptive strategies to changing environments. Furthermore, it aids in developing rational strategies for wildlife management and conservation. Importantly, research on animal immune systems may lead to the identification of novel bioactive molecules with potential applications in biomedicine.

This project aims to conduct a functional analysis of candidate genes previously identified as participants in the immune response of a hydrozoan species. The functional analysis will investigate the timing and mode of gene expression following immune challenges and the identification and functional assessment of antimicrobial peptides. The project will be carried out through three distinct research modalities: a master's thesis, an undergraduate degree project, and a research seedbed initiative.

Collaboration with external contributors, including Anthony De Tomaso from Stanford University, Thomas Bosch from the University of Kiel, MÃ³nica Medina from the University of California, and Horacio Samaniego from the University of Valdivia, This provided me valuable expertise and insights in the field of evolutionary immunology. Through this multidisciplinary approach, the project seeks to advance our understanding of immune response mechanisms in diverse animal lineages and uncover potential therapeutic applications for biomedicine.
