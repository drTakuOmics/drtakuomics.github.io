## Omic landscape in proteasome degradation

**Project description:** This current project aims to investigate the role of proteasome regulation, hyperactivity and proteasome activators, in neurodegeneration using C. elegans Knock-Out (KO) models expressing key pathogenic proteins. The research will employ a combination of omics approaches, including mass spectrometry-based proteomics and RNA sequencing, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind the hyperactive proteasome mutant. By studying these mechanisms and their impact on protein degradation and cellular processes, the project seeks to advance our understanding of proteasome regulation and its implications in neurodegenerative diseases.
