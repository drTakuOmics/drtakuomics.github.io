## Proteasomal hyperactivation as therapeutic target for proteinopathies

**Project description:** We determined the effects of 20S proteasome hyperactivation on proteostasis and lipid metabolism in _C. elegans_.Methods:RNA-seq and proteomics (TMT-MS) were performed to analyze changes in the proteome and transcriptome. We validated lipid metabolism through biochemical assays and monitored stress resistance using oxidative stress tests.

**Brief Summary of Results:**
Hyperactivation of the 20S proteasome led to significant rewiring of the proteome and transcriptome. Enhanced oxidative stress defense mechanisms were observed, alongside accelerated lipid metabolism and increased peroxisome proliferation. Improved ER-associated degradation (ERAD) of aggregation-prone proteins, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin (ATZ) was detected. Unique longevity effects independent of known pathways were identified suggesting novel therapeutic implications for proteostasis-related disorders.

**Brief Conclusion:**
The study demonstrates the potential of 20S proteasome activation as a therapeutic strategy to enhance cellular health and longevity. These findings underscore the complexity of proteasome-mediated cellular processes and highlight avenues for future research in proteostasis and aging mechanisms.
