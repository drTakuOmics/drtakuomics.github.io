## ProEnd Database for HbYX Motif-Containing Proteins

**Project Description:**
This project aimed to create ProEnd, a comprehensive database to catalog HbYX motif-containing proteins across all life forms. This was achieved using a bioinformatics pipeline analyzing millions of proteins from the UniProt/SwissProt database, highlighting the motif's evolutionary conservation and its implications in proteostasis and disease.

**Brief Summary of Results:** 
The study successfully identified a widespread presence of HbYX motifs, particularly noting a significant occurrence in viral proteomes which suggests potential strategic interactions with the host proteasome. This extensive dataset enables new hypotheses for advancing proteasome biology.

**Brief Conclusion:** 
ProEnd offers a significant resource for researchers exploring proteasomal regulation, potentially aiding in the discovery of new therapeutic targets for diseases like cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. This tool enhances our understanding of proteasome activity across life forms and supports further research into proteostasis-related therapies.
