## Biology of Proteasome Activator PA28y, implications as potential therapheutic target

**Project description:** 
Our current efforts focus on understanding the physiological role of the proteasome activator PA28, recognized for its involvement in ubiquitin-independent protein degradation pathways that are linked to immune response, neurodegeneration and other proteinopathies. Notably, PA28 also exhibits increased expression under cold stress, highlighting its role in adaptation to environmental changes. This project aims to identify substrates of the PA28/20S complex to better comprehend the network of processes that this activator from the 11S family influences, thereby deepening our understanding of its functional roles in cellular health.

If you're curious about how the 20S proteasome is regulated by the 11S/PA28 family and its implications for cellular health and disease, our latest review offers an in-depth exploration of these crucial mechanisms. We delve into their structure, function, and evolutionary significance in maintaining proteostasis.
