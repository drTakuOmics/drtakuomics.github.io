## Transcriptomic analysis

**Project description:** This study aimed to investigate the transcriptomic changes in adipose tissue during the periparturient period in dairy cows, which is a crucial phase encompassing the time before and after calving. The periparturient period is characterized by significant physiological and metabolic changes that can affect the health and productivity of dairy cows. Adipose tissue plays a central role in energy homeostasis and lipid metabolism during this period.

### 1. Approach

The researchers collected subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue samples from 14 multiparous Holstein cows at three different time points: prepartum (âˆ’30 days relative to parturition), at parturition (calving), and postpartum (+30 days relative to parturition). RNA-seq was performed  and  we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and gene ontology (GO) terms related to inflammation, remodeling, and lipid metabolism in the adipose tissue.

### 2. Brief summary of results

The results revealed a total of 3,178 DEGs in subcutaneous adipose tissue and 1,589 DEGs in omental adipose tissue across the three time points. GO analysis showed that genes related to immune system processes, cell motility, and extracellular matrix organization were significantly enriched during the periparturient period. Additionally, genes associated with lipid metabolism and lipid droplet formation were differentially expressed during this period, suggesting an adaptation in lipid metabolism.

### 3. Brief conclusion

The study's findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying adipose tissue inflammation, remodeling, and lipid metabolism during the periparturient period in dairy cows. Understanding these mechanisms can help develop strategies to improve the health and productivity of dairy cows during this critical phase.

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
